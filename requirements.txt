# keras might still be brought in by tensorflow but they way it is imported now (2.9->2.10 change?)

keras

# numpy and PIL/Pillow came in already as a result of tensorflow most likely, but PyCharm is
# complaining that they are not in the reqs, so here they are to get
# rid of the warning. The imports work in either case.
